INTRODUCTION:
Below is the Progressive Restrictive Open Source License (PROSL), crafted to reflect the values and
principles of its author, Andrés Brugarolas Martínez, and others who might adhere to it, while establishing
guidelines for the use, modification, and distribution of the Software under this license.

While not mandatory, the Author would appreciate that any changes, bug fixes or new features would be pulled
back to the official repository, so more people can benefit from them.

The Author wants to warn you that this License may looks like a mix of both a License and a political manifesto.
From the Author's point of view: there is no distinction between them, as every interaction between two or more
sentient human beings is in one way or another always political. Just we have assumed that the usual, normalized
interactions are non-political, but they are. In fact, trying that your values do not affect your software or
your business is an ideology itself: a moderate conservative one, or pro-status quo one in the best scenario.

The Author wants to recall you that in some countries, a normalized and alledgedly non-political tradition, is to
punish, torture or even murder women for not covering their face or their hair. While that seems brutal and non-sensical
in western countries, the native individuals who oppose that tradition are often perceived as subversive and revolutionary
by the ones who support or don't actually care about that tradition. And these revolutionary individuals are usually
harashed by local extremist groups, paramilitary organizations, the armed forces, and/or police agencies.

The Author; a Spanish guy in his early-30s who has been spent an immeasurable ammount of money on lawyers, who has been
assaulted by police officers multiple times, who has been detained for days in countless occassions, who has been prosecuted several
times and who has faced the possibility of going to jail because of his activism a couple of times (apparently defending that everybody deserves a place to live is a dangerous
ideology that society should fight against); strongly believes that the same principle can be applied to... well, universally.
Just because you don't consider that mixing software licensing with values is a good idea or don't like my progressive values,
does not make me a "radical" and does not make you neutral: you just happen to have the same values/ideas/ideology than the majority.
I could write for hours about this subject, but even if you think it is: this is not a political manifesto, it's a License. But values and
actions are inseparable.

As a final note: I'm not an English native speaker, so expect typos in this License. Even if grammar is an arbitrary
social construct, I try my best to respect it. And writing a License may be beyond my English capabilities. However,
typos does not mean in any ocassion that any term of this License is invalid. If I made any mistake, typo, or didn't
express myself in an understandable way, feel free to contact me.

Oh, and if your company is looking for new people to hire, I'm open to new opportunities. Even if I'm openly left-winged, I'm a good
professional and a good developer. And remote working and my lack of social skills in English will make it impossible that
I try to convince your employees to join a workers' union. And the fact that I'm openly left-winged may even play in your favor,
because the more diverse the team is, the less bias the software will have. Particularly in the AI development.

SUMMARY:
This license allows individuals and organizations that align with progressive values to freely use, modify,
and distribute this software. Restrictions are placed on certain entities, particularly those associated
with military or mercenary activities, and those that don't uphold certain progressive principles.

Redistribution is encouraged under open-source licenses that are compatible with this one.

Compatibility terms are described below.

TERMS:
Free Use: Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual, public administration, or
non-profit organization obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"),
to deal in with the Software without any limitation to the rights to use, modify, and distribute this Software,
provided they do not violate the restrictions listed below and ensure these restrictions are met.

Any individual, public administration, or non-profit organization that makes use of this Software, redistribute it,
or modify it, has the obligation to conserve this copyright with the information about the original Author intact
and has the responsibility of enforcing the terms, limitations and rights this License entails are met.

This Software or any derivative of it may not be sublicensed, merged with any other software with private or
incompatible license, commodified, be sold, monetized, or be used in any kind of commercial activity; including
but not limiting to any software-as-a-service like, data-mining or crypto-mining commercial activities; without
the express consent of the original Author, who might ask for a compensation in return.

The Author is well aware that the last sentence may sound a bit controversial, however, he wants you to know that
he is a reasonable person and wants to remind you that commercial activities are not prohibited: you just have to ask him
for consent. In fact, the Author consider that the development of economy, wether by public or private initiatives,
is a good thing, so he/she would be happy to know that his/her software helps your company.
The compensations the Author may ask you in return are not necessarily monetary ones, but to collaborate
together in the development of this Software or other software, free use or your software-as-a-service, promotion of his
Software in your platforms, granting free access to source code of some of your software, or most likely nothing at all.

This Software, any modification of it or any derivate of it must conserve this original License (PROSL) and not even
the original Author is entitled to negotiate or make any kind of deal that states the opposite. If any code of this
Software is included in other software, included files must start with a comment about original Author, his webpage,
original project repository, small PROSL License statement, and this LICENSE should be included intact into the new
project's License.

Any kind of deal with the original Author does not mean under any circunstance that this Software may be sold, monetized,
retristributed or used under a different license; does not mean neither that the other party is exempt of enforcing this
license, the rights it guarantees to users and the restrictions it imposes to certain entities or activities; nor gives
it the right to the other party to negotiate about the use, sell, redistribution, monetization, or modification of this
Software with any third parties without the original Author express consent.

1. Company and Commercial Restrictions:
Companies with more than 10 employees must notify the original Author about the nature of their usage of this Software.

Companies with over 50 employees require express consent from the original Author for usage, modification and/or redistribution
of this Software.

Any kind of commercial activity, monetization or commodification of this Software and any derivate of it requires express consent
from the original Author.

2. Exceptions:
The following organizations are not considered companies or are exempt of company restrictions:

Worker unions.

Cooperative businesses where at least 80% of ownership is worker-based.

Left wing organizations, civil rights organizations, womens rights organizations, anti-racist organizations, anti-fascist
organizations, and LGTB rights organizations.

Public administrations or state-owned companies from countries provided they align with progressive values described below.

3. Prohibited Entities:
Military, paramilitary, criminal organizations, police forces or agencies, mercenary companies or private security companies,
intelligence agencies, military companies, public or private penitentiary systems, and companies with affiliations to such entities.

Any kind of organization dedicated to drug, human or weapon trafficking, even if they have not been proven to be criminal organizations.

Any entity that promotes hate, discrimination, misinformation or any form of violence against individuals based on race, gender,
sexual orientation, or any other discriminatory grounds. Except those clearly aligned with anti-repressive or anti-fascist values.
The Author does not consider that publicly denouncing police brutality or the injustices of the differents global penal systems constitute
any kind of discrimination against cops or judges. And about anti-fascist values: the Author wants to quote the "Paradox of tolerance":
any society that wants to be effectively tolerant, must not tolerate any kind of anti-tolerance behaviour. Fighting against fascism
should be a major priority for all individuals who believe all humans deserve the same human rights. That's not just rhetoric to the Author,
this license is prove of that.

Racist, fascist, misogynist, nationalist, anti-communist or right-wing extremist individuals, groups, communities, parties, organizations
or media, even if they don't explicitly promote hate, discrimination, misinformation or any kind of violence against any individuals.

The Author is aware that the last sentence is a bit vague and open to interpretation, however, if you felt uncomfortable or felt referenced
while reading it, there is a high change that you are part of the list and you should reconsider your values. If you are "not sexist, but..."
or you are "not racist, but...", there is a really high chance you are blacklisted. Nothing good will come out of your mouth after the "but",
and starting an argument with "I am not racist" is already a red flag: people who are not racist usually don't have to remind others that they
are not racists. The Author doesn't need to tell anybody that he/she's not a 80-year-old lady because he/she doesn't look like an 80-year-old lady.
As a software developer, the Author is not particularly a fan of duck typing (he's more a Liskov Substition Principle person). You know, the
application of the "duck test" abductive reasoning to [computer science] objects: "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like
a duck: then it must be a duck". So if you need to remind someone that you are not a racist, and genuinely don't consider yourself racist...
The Author has bad news for you. And he thinks that Barbara Liskov would agree with him/her on that. The Author is not an simple abductive
heuristics person, but he has to admit that Okham's razor is very useful for detecting "naive bigotries". Good news is that it's never late for
a change. First step is to learn some logical reasoning and real statistics and always remember that correlation does not imply causation before
quoting that statistic about crime segmented by skin color. Yeah, he/she knows you have done it. The Author can play the statistics game too: for
example, how many people living paycheck to paycheck do commit tax fraud? Or Google how many blue lives abuse their wives. You are not going
to like it. The Author is sorry if you feel discriminated. He/she's flexible enough to adapt to the rules when he/she's coding for others. But this
time, the Author is coding for free and for himself/herself, so he/she is making the rules now. If you don't like his/her progressive values just
don't hire him/her in your company nor use his/her software: there are plenty of Open Source "yes-you-can-use-our-software-to-sell-crack-online"
(as long as you credit them) projects available on the Internet, and probably with a higher quality or more feature-complete than his'/her's. After all, this is his/her software, and as spanish people say: "Esta es mi licencia y me la follo cuando quiera" (please, don't translate that).

4. Redistribution:
Redistribution is allowed under open-source licenses that allow dual-licensing and which do not conflict with the terms of this License.

Redistributors must retain the original license and provide free access to the source code of, at least, this or any piece of this Software is being used.

5. Progressive Values:
A country must meet the following conditions to be considered aligned with progressive values: free universal education, free universal health system,
secular governance, free elections under the supervision of independant and international authorities, and equal rights for all individuals irrespective
of race, gender, or sexual orientation.

However, any country that met the previous conditions but infringe any of the following is not considered to be aligned with progressive values and is
excluded from the exceptions: countries with references to any religion in their national anthem or flags, or that give special status to any religion,
or have military forces (excluding UN peacekeepers) deployed outside their borders, or provide military aid to countries at war or to any country that
is not meeting the aforementioned standards.

The Author is aware that excludes half of the countries that are generally considered progressive, but he wrote that on purpose. The Author does not
consider militarism, selling weapons, profitting from other's countries wars or aiding dictatorships are progressive values. And about the military:
the armed forces and all its branches are a necessary evil, which are supposed to be defensive forces for granting their citizen's integrity and rights
agains external threats, so you may ask yourself how exactly are the armed forces defending your rights in a foreign country. There is a name for that:
it is imperialism, and it is not a progressive value. If "global stability" or "national security" are really the main concerns of such missions, then
diplomacy, commerce, humanitary aid, healthcare and educational aid, and UN consensual approved interventions are the answer to the problem.

6. No Warranties:
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

7. Universality:
This license is meant to be universally applicable, however it was written in a specific european country jurisdiction context by someone whose native
language is not English, so it is possible that some aspects are not clear enough or that they conflict with any local, state, national or federal laws of
some other countries. If you have any doubt about its applicability, please, consult a lawyer or contact the original Author to ask him about your doubts,
or to develop for you a similar software of your ownership and more tailored to your needs.

8. Compatible Licenses:
A compatible license is one that:

Must allow that the parts of the Software under PROSL license or any derivative of it are allowed to be distributed under the same terms and the same
original PROSL license or any derivative of it.

Respects and upholds the restrictions placed on certain entities, as outlined in this license.

Does not permit sublicensing under terms that would violate the principles of PROSL.

Ensures that redistributions continue to enforce the guidelines of PROSL, especially concerning prohibited entities and consensual commercial restrictions.

Allows for open-source dual-licensing, ensuring that the software remains freely accessible and modifiable by those who adhere to PROSL's values.

9. Attribution:
Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the previous conditions and the conditions below
are met.

These conditions require a modest attribution to Andrés Brugarolas Martínez (the "Author"), who hopes that its promotional value may help justify the thousands
of dollars in otherwise billable time invested in writing this and other freely available, open-source software.

Redistributions of source code, in whole or part and with or without modification (the "Code"), must prominently display this GPG-signed text in verifiable form.

Redistributions of the Code in binary form must be accompanied by this GPG-signed text in any documentation and, each time the resulting executable program or a
program dependent thereon is launched, a prominent display (e.g., splash screen or banner text) of the Author’s attribution information, which includes:

(a) Complete name of the Author/s and/or any pseudonyms they may have included in their Software's license,

(b) Professional identifications if she/he/they have included it in their Software's license, and

(c) URL to her/his/their professional web page, personal web pages, GitHub or GitLab accounts, or any other professional or social media platforms they have
included in their Software's license.

Neither the name/s nor any trademark of the Author/s may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Software without specific prior written permission.

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR:
1. Contributors' Rights:
